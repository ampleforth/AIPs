<p>
  Ampleforth Improvement Proposals (AIPs) describe standards for the Ampleforth
  platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract
  standards.
</p>
<p>
  Ampleforth Configuration Change Proposals(ACCPs) are similar to AIPs, but concern modifications to system configuration values such as equilibrium_threshold and the orchestrator transactions list. ACCPs live in the same repository and website as AIPs do, but have a <a href="https://github.com/Ampleforth/AIPs/blob/master/accp-X.md ">slightly different specification</a>.

    <a href="https://github.com/ampleforth/AIPs">AIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR (Pull Request) should be a first draft of the final AIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new AIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the AIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your AIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that AIP as follow:
  <code>assets/aip-X</code> (for aip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  AIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/aip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your AIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it
  can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community
  agrees to include it, the AIP editors will update the state of your AIP to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
