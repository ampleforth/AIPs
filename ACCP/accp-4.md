## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ACCP.-->
With an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution for the AMPL/WETH geyser program via an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol is proposed to address high gas fees on the Ethereum network for the purpose of lowering the barrier to entry and supporting adoption of Ampleforth as a base money, store of value and unit of exchange.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
Ethereum gas fees are a significant entry barrier to new market participants and will likely become a financial burden to existing AMPL hodlers given the projected network congestion that will follow increased activity as the cryptocurrency marketcap substantially increases in 2021.
The recent announcement of Ampleforth's cross-chain integration with Tron, Polkadot, and NEAR blockchains is a step forward in providing more economical options for AMPL hodlers and LPs to engage with the ecosystem. However, the majority of decentralized borrowing, lending and trading occurs on the Ethereum blockchain as of 2020, and a solution for decreasing transaction costs should be a high priority for the team.
The Ampleforth protocol should provide support for transcations on Ethereum Layer 2 networks such as xDai, MATIC or Loopring to bridge the gap in low-cost transaction services until Ethereum 2.0 scaling is fully implemented.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for ACCPs that want to update variables within Ampleforth. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. ACCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Ampleforth is one of the leading innovative blockchains in cryptocurrency, and the geyser programs are arguably the most important tools currently growing the Ampleforth ecosystem. Once the gas fees become too high, however, there will be a massive loss in potential new hodlers and LPs. The motivation is to keep the community growing and define Ampleforth's position as a core primitive digital asset alongside BTC and ETH.
With an Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, for example xDai, AMPL hodlers can pair AMPL/WETH on a Uniswap-like DEX called Honeyswap.exchange for a future geyser program to lower the entry barrier for average market participants. To improve decentralization of the Ampleforth network, the Ethereum Layer 2 protocol for AMPL/WETH pairing could be decided by community vote and discussion to expand support for either:
-xDai network on honeyswap.exchange
-MATIC network on quickswap.exchange
-Loopring network on exchange.loopring.io
The selected Ethereum L2 solution should prioritize accessibility, depth of liquidity and security. The Ampleforth protocol can continue to lead in innovation within the crypto space by driving adoption for Ethereum L2 DEXs by utilizing the popular geyser programs.
